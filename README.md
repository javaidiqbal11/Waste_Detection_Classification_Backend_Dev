# Waste Backend FastAPI 
---
This project contains the backend infrastructure for a waste management application. The application leverages computer vision and machine learning to enable waste detection and classification, aiming to streamline waste processing and sorting.

Overview
This backend system is designed to support the development of an AI-driven waste management application. It provides APIs for detecting and classifying waste types based on image inputs and integrates a YOLO model for optimized image recognition. Additionally, it includes endpoints for managing waste-related data, annotations, and integrations with the broader waste management ecosystem.
